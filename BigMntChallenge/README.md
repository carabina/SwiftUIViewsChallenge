#  SwiftUI Views Challenge by Big Mountain Studio

This project contains example views made during SwiftUI Views Challenge Pilot program.

Views are supposed to be viewed as independent views but for easy browsing they were embeded in wrapper view (this could break individual views which are not supposed to be used as child view of Navigation View)

Views were inspired by example layouts published on Pinterest. They are not supposed to be 1 to 1 copy of presented view but rather as base for reimplementing in as much details as possible during the challenge.
